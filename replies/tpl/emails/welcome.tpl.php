Hey <?php echo $username; ?>,

Thanks for activating the replies service from TwitApps. We hope you enjoy the service.

We have now started keeping track of replies sent to you and will send you them by email at reasonable intervals.

You can control this service with direct messages to @<?php echo $GLOBALS['_twitter']['username']; ?>. Send "stop" to stop receiving the emails, and "start" to start getting them again.

Hope that's clear. Thanks for using TwitApps - be sure to tell your friends about us!
