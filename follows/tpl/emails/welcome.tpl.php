Hey <?php echo $username; ?>,

Thanks for activating the follows service from TwitApps. We hope you enjoy the service.

We have now started keeping track of your followers and will send you a daily email summarising changes.

You can control this service with direct messages to @<?php echo $GLOBALS['_twitter']['username']; ?>. Send "stop" to stop receiving the emails, and "start" to start getting them again. You can also change when we send you emails. See http://twitapps.com/follows for full details.

Thanks for using TwitApps - be sure to tell your friends about us!
